# javascript-todoList-v1.0

------------------------------
BACKGROUND:
------------------------------

I'm learning JavaScript by doing (making apps), and by taking courses to build/reinforce basic knowledge (e.g., freecodecamp.org, sololearn.com). I started working on a todo list app I found on codepen, but hit a wall.

I enjoy writing detailed comments - it ensures I better undersand things, and I'm sure the comments will be useful when I revisit things. The todo lis I was working on became a struggle - specifically when I came accross arrow functions, nested functions, and passing functions as parameters (I think ...).

PROJECT PURPOSE
------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to recreate a more basic "todo list app." The app tuturoial can be found on w3schools.com.
